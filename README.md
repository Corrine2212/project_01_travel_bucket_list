# project_01_travel_bucket_list

## Project description:
### What does the application do?
This is my first ever CodeClan project! The brief I chose called for an app that could track someone's travel adventures.
The app had to meet the following criteria:
- app should allow the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited.
- app needed to have CRUD functionality:
  - user should be able to create and edit countries
  - each country should have one or more cities to visit
  - the user should be able to create and delete entries for cities
  - the app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see.
  
**For extra functionality/features, I could include:**
  - seperate pages for destinations visited and those still to visit
  - add sights to the destination cities
  - search for destination by continent, city or country
  - ability to upload pictures and have them displayed on thumbnails
  - extra input fields for notes and date to visit place

### Technologies used and why?
For the last 4 weeks i've been learning Python, HTML, CSS, Flask framework, Djinja and psql to build a full stack web application. The aim of this project was to consolidate everything that i've learned using the aforementioned languages and framework.
